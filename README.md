Abstract

Since 2008, SDN (Software Defined Networks) concepts have gained a lot of attention among computer network engineers and researchers, mainly due to the big flexibility that the concepts of this paradigm bring to network management. This dissertation introduces a new methodology of INT measurements in software-defined networks. For programming the network devices were used the language P4 (Programming Protocol-independent Packet Processors). P4 is a language used to define network device behavior and was used to implement the INT (in-band network telemetry) method, a framework that collects network status information. Most of the INT applications are restrained to data centers environments or simulated ones. The main objective of this work was to use these techniques in hardware to monitor the MAN (Metropolitan Area Network). This research applied some INT metrics, like timestamp, flow path, and hop latency. The results obtained in this dissertation demonstrate that the packets sent to the data collector are formatted according to the solution programmed in the data plane. Another achievement was that the programmed model allows the capture of data in a network flow. In conclusion, INT flow, the presented final solution, performed monitoring in the lesser granularity of time (milliseconds) than other protocols like SNMP (seconds), currently used in telecommunications companies.
